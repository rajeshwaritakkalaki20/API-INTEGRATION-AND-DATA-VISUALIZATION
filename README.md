##1. API Integration and Data Visualization

Project Description:

This project involves retrieving real-time or static data from third-party APIs (e.g., weather, finance, or COVID-19 data) and visualizing it using Python libraries. It helps in understanding how APIs work and how data can be interpreted visually.

Use Case:

Example: Fetching real-time COVID-19 statistics for different countries and plotting them on a graph to show trends.

Project Work Includes:

Connecting to REST APIs using requests or httpx.

Parsing JSON/XML responses.

Cleaning and organizing data.

Creating visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts).

Optional: Creating an interactive dashboard using Dash or Streamlit.

Tools/Libraries Used:

requests or httpx – for API calls.

pandas – for data manipulation.

matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly – for visualization.

json – for handling API responses.

Skills Gained:

API handling, data cleaning, visualization techniques, working with real-world data.##

##2. Script to Read, Analyze, and Generate PDF Report

Project Description:

This script reads data from a local file (like a CSV), performs analysis (summary, statistics, trends), and then creates a formatted PDF report that includes charts and tables. It’s ideal for automating reports.

Use Case:

Generating weekly sales performance reports from a CSV file for a business.

Project Work Includes:

Reading data using pandas.

Performing data analysis: average, max, min, trends.

Creating visualizations like pie charts or bar graphs.

Designing a layout for the PDF report.

Exporting charts and content into the PDF using libraries.

Tools/Libraries Used:

pandas – for data manipulation.

matplotlib/seaborn – for creating graphs.

FPDF or ReportLab – for creating PDF reports.

os, datetime – for file handling and timestamps.

Skills Gained:

Report automation, file I/O, basic data analytics, and PDF generation.##

##3. Chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Project Description:

This project develops a chatbot using NLP that can understand user queries, extract intent, and respond with meaningful answers. The chatbot can be rule-based or enhanced with basic machine learning/NLP.

Use Case:

A FAQ chatbot for a university website that answers questions about admissions, courses, and deadlines.

Project Work Includes:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, stop words removal).

Intent classification (rule-based or ML-based).

Training simple models (optional).

Developing conversational flow.

Integration with a front-end or console-based interface.

Tools/Libraries Used:

NLTK or spaCy – for NLP tasks.

sklearn – for text classification (optional).

flask – to deploy chatbot as a web app (optional).

regex, json – for message processing and formatting.

Skills Gained:

NLP fundamentals, chatbot logic design, tokenization, named entity recognition (NER).##

##4. Predictive Model using Scikit-learn (e.g., Spam Detection)

Project Description:

This project builds a machine learning model that classifies data (e.g., spam vs. not spam) using scikit-learn. It covers the entire ML pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Use Case:

Detecting whether an email is spam or not using historical email data.

Project Work Includes:

Importing and cleaning data (usually text data).

Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.

Splitting dataset into training and testing sets.

Training models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).

Evaluating model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Tools/Libraries Used:

pandas, numpy – for data handling.

scikit-learn – for model building, evaluation.

matplotlib, seaborn – for visualizing evaluation metrics.

NLTK or spaCy – for text preprocessing.

Skills Gained:

Supervised learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation, text classification.
